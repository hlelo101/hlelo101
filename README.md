Somebody that writes code and do things for 3 reasons:
- Because I can
- Because why not
- Because it's fun

A lot of my projects might be useless, but at least they work and exist (I think).

You can take a look at [my website](https://hlelo101.github.io), if you want to (it doesn't have an UI for phones tho).\
I like VSCode's solarized dark theme
I also love blur effects
