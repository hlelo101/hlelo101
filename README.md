# ðŸ‘‹ Hello
I'm somebody that writes code and do things for 3 reasons:
- Because I can
- Because why not
- Because it's fun

I'm passionate about a lot of things about IT.\
A lot of my projects might be useless, but at least they work and exist (I think).\
Most of my projects are small, simple or minimalistic apps.

You can take a look at [my website](https://hlelo101.github.io), if you want to (it doesn't have an UI for phones tho).

<img src="vscodeIcon.png" alt="VScode icon" width="15" height="15"> I like to use **VSCode** as my main editor and I like the solarized dark theme\
I also like blur effects a lot.

I like to code in **C++**, but I also like web developement (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**).
