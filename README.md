# ðŸ‘‹ Hello
I'm somebody that writes code and do things for 3 reasons:
- Because I can
- Why not
- It's fun

I'm passionate about a lot of things in IT.\
A lot of my projects might be useless, but at least they work (or do they?) and exist (I think).\
Most of my projects are small and simple apps, don't expect much from me.

You can take a look at [my website](https://hlelo101.github.io), if you want.

<img src="vscodeIcon.png" alt="VScode icon" width="15" height="15"> I like to use **VSCode** as my main editor and I like the solarized dark theme\
I also like blur effects a lot.

I like to code in **C++**, but I also like web developement (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**).

Some stats because why not:\
